                <h1>The Screen Time Chronicles: A Journey Through My Digital Habits</h1>

                <p> Having the ability to constantly track the way we live, has been something that I think everyone if not most people have accepted.
                    I myself, have been recording my habits or steps or intake in some form, for years now. It started off with tracking your steps to see how many did that 
                    day or week or even comparing against your friends. Eventually, that shifted fully into Apple Watches, FitBits or Oura Rings, just to name a few. It was and is 
                    a method of staying on track and being aware of your performance and health overtime. Not to mention, it has also became a tool for others to use daily, such as healthcare professionals 
                    to elderly people. 

                <p> Not to sound selfish but this is mainly about myself and how I've tracked my cellphone use over a period of time. 
                    I tracked specific categories for a month, and I was able to understand my daily habits. I think it is important to know your daily habits or routines, 
                    so if there is something that can be changed or improved, you are able to see the data on a visual chart and make the necessary changes that suit you.
                    As for predictions of what I thought my screen time would be, I was not too surprised by what I found!
                    As a design student and someone who is always staring at a screen, it did not surprise me at all that my screen time was higher in some areas than others. 
                    I created some charts below that display my habits that I found during this time!</p>

                        <p> After not paying too much attention to the trackers in my phone, I thought this would be the perfect time to try it out and see if 
                            was as crazy as I thought. I decided to organize all the activity into categories, so that would be easily understood! Social Media, Entertainment, 
                            Productivity & Health, were the four sections that are apart of my daily life. Although I don't remember giving my phone access to let it track this information
                        (I'm pretty sure that I agreed to it a while ago or when I first got the phone - hahaha) </p>
