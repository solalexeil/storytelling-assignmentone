                <h1>The Screen Time Chronicles: A Journey Through My Digital Habits</h1>
                <p>In a world where our lives are increasingly intertwined with digital devices, I decided to embark on a journey to understand my relationship with my phone. 
                    Armed with screen time tracking tools, I set out to uncover the patterns, habits, and perhaps even the hidden truths behind my daily screen usage.
                    What started as a simple curiosity soon turned into a fascinating exploration of my digital life.</p>

                <h2>Where is this data from?</h2>
                <p>For one month, I constantly tracked my screen time, then organizing each session into different categories:
                Social Media, Entertainment, Productivity and Other. The data that I gathered using my phone's built-in tracker.
                Being able to have access to this extensive data allowed me to analyze my screen time habits and patterns, 
                and see where all the time has gone.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
            <p>The first step was to gather all the data I needed. 
                After ignoring my phone's screen time tracker for years, this was the time to pay more attention to it. 
                Everyday I monitored my screen time, and organized them in their own categories: Social Media, Entertainment, Productivity and Other.
                Although I do not remember letting them have this data (I am sure I agreed to it at some point), as time went on I grew to appreciate it.
                When it came down to it, I was able to see how much time I spent on my phone, and where all that time went. 
                These numbers proved to me that I have more phone habits than I thought I did. Boredom? Stress? Inflation? Anxiety? (or all at the same time!)
                No wonder I was always tired. I was always on my phone.
                Now it's time to really display this data so I can get it together!
